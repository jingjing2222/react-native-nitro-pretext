We want this community to be friendly and respectful to each other. Please follow it in all your interactions with the project. Before contributing, please read the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Development workflow

This project is a single library package with a Yarn workspace for the example app. It contains:

- The library package in the root directory.
- An example app in the `example/` directory.

To get started with the project, make sure you have the correct version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. See the [`.nvmrc`](./.nvmrc) file for the version used in this project.

Run `yarn` in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:

```sh
yarn
```

> Since the project relies on Yarn workspaces, you cannot use [`npm`](https://github.com/npm/cli) for development without manually migrating.

This project uses Nitro Modules. If you're not familiar with how Nitro works, make sure to check the [Nitro Modules Docs](https://nitro.margelo.com/).

You need to run [Nitrogen](https://nitro.margelo.com/docs/nitrogen) to generate the boilerplate code required for this project. The example app will not build without this step.

Run **Nitrogen** in following cases:

- When you make changes to any `*.nitro.ts` files.
- When running the project for the first time (since the generated files are not committed to the repository).

To invoke **Nitrogen**, use the following command:

```sh
yarn nitrogen
```

The [example app](/example/) demonstrates usage of the library. You need to run it to test any changes you make.

It is configured to use the local version of the library, so any changes you make to the library's source code will be reflected in the example app. Changes to the library's JavaScript code will be reflected in the example app without a rebuild, but native code changes will require a rebuild of the example app.

If you want to use Android Studio or Xcode to edit the native code, you can open the `example/android` or `example/ios` directories respectively in those editors. To edit the Objective-C or Swift files, open `example/ios/PretextExample.xcworkspace` in Xcode and find the source files at `Pods > Development Pods > react-native-nitro-pretext`.

To edit the Java or Kotlin files, open `example/android` in Android studio and find the source files at `react-native-nitro-pretext` under `Android`.

You can use various commands from the root directory to work with the project.

To start the packager:

```sh
yarn example start
```

To run the example app on Android:

```sh
yarn example android
```

To run the example app on iOS:

```sh
yarn example ios
```

To confirm that the app is running with the new architecture, you can check the Metro logs for a message like this:

```sh
Running "PretextExample" with {"fabric":true,"initialProps":{"concurrentRoot":true},"rootTag":1}
```

Note the `"fabric":true` and `"concurrentRoot":true` properties.

Make sure your code passes TypeScript:

```sh
yarn typecheck
```

Make sure the package still builds:

```sh
yarn build
```

Remember to add tests for your change if possible. Run the unit tests by:

```sh
yarn test
```

### Scripts

The `package.json` file contains various scripts for common tasks:

- `yarn`: setup project by installing dependencies.
- `yarn build`: build the package with Bob and regenerate Nitro outputs.
- `yarn typecheck`: type-check files with TypeScript.
- `yarn test`: run unit tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
- `yarn changeset`: create a release note and version bump entry for publishable changes.
- `yarn version-packages`: apply pending Changesets locally.
- `yarn example start`: start the Metro server for the example app.
- `yarn example android`: run the example app on Android.
- `yarn example ios`: run the example app on iOS.

### Releases

This repository uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for versioning and npm releases.
The example app workspace remains private, so only the root `react-native-nitro-pretext` package is published to npm.

For any change that should ship to npm, add a Changeset:

```sh
yarn changeset
```

The `Release` GitHub workflow watches `main`. If there are unpublished Changesets, it opens or updates a release PR. When that PR is merged into `main`, the same workflow publishes the package to npm.

To make the publish step work in GitHub Actions, configure an `NPM_TOKEN` repository secret with publish access to the npm package.

### Sending a pull request

> **Working on your first pull request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

When you're sending a pull request:

- Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.
- Verify that linters and tests are passing.
- Review the documentation to make sure it looks good.
- Follow the pull request template when opening a pull request.
- For pull requests that change the API or implementation, discuss with maintainers first by opening an issue.
